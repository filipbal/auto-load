## for ECOM Flash Service
### Version: 0.3

**AutoLoad** is an automation tool designed to simplify the process of updating firmware on multiple devices using the ECOM Flash Service application. It provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting COM ports and loader versions, enabling efficient and hassle-free firmware updates.
